        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Last updated: March 12, 2020</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>

        <h1>Collecting and Using Your Personal Data</h1>
        <h2>Types of Data Collected</h2>

        <p>None! We don't collect any information on you at all, without exception.</p>
        <p>Google may collect information on the downloads of the extension, as they do with all extensions. For more information, see their privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We can't use what we don't collect! Nothing is collected, so nothing is used.</p>

        <h2>Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We retain all of the personal data we collect on you...so that's nothing then.</p>

        <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>If somebody buys Paradox from us, we'll send them all of the personal data we've collected (you guessed it, we'll send them nothing)!</p>

        <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>If we collected personal data, we'd probably have some security procedures in place, but since we don't collect any personal information, there's nothing to keep secure.</p>

        <h2>Information Requests</h2>
        <p>You can make an information request at any time by emailing us. You'll get an empty email back though...</p>

        <h2>Reject Data Collection</h2>
        <p>You have the right to object to data collection at any time by emailing us and we'll instantly delete that email to get rid of the bit of data you've ever sent us.</p>

        <h1>Links to Other Websites</h1>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

        <h1>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
        <p>But don't worry, we will never collect any personal information.</p>

        <h1>Contact Us</h1>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, You can contact us by email: privacy@privacyparadox.co.uk</p>
